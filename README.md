# A.I. Voice Assistant

Created for EEL4709 Computer Design course in Florida International University.

The main objective of the project was to create an always online voice assistant on a Raspberry Pi Model 4, like Google Home or Amazon Alexa, capable of answering questions and responding to user voice input. The focus was on providing users with a voice-activated interface to interact with the Bing Chat bot that is accessible with the Microsoft Edge browser effectively. 

Components Used:
Headphones, USB Microphone, LEDs, 220 Ohm Resistors, Raspberry Pi
